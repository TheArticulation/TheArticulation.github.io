**Discussion Content**
1. *Personal Experience.* In my personal experience the EA ideas and community has presented me with a significant amount of value. This meeting will begin with a personal description of my experience with EA ideas and the EA community. I will share how EA enabled me to express express the following personal incentives: 
	- Scaled Empathy and Sympathy  
	- Individual Life Affirmation  
	- Social Confidence and Personal Identity Development
2. *Please consider what incentives motivate you.* The simplest motivation for EA is that the world is terribly flawed, but we know that progress is possible.Â  We can, with enough determination and effort, alleviate the suffering of countless others.
3. *What do you want to get from the program?* We hope that you will use the program to learn more about things that will help you improve the world.
