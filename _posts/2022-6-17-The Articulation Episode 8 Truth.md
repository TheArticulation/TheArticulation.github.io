This post contains insights that explain what "Truth" is. It is the first part of Episode 8 of The Articulation. The rest of the episode will be covered in other posts. 

# Definitions
## Systems Thinking
- “Systems thinking is a holistic approach to analysis that focuses on the way that a system's constituent parts interrelate and how systems work over time and within the context of larger systems” - Ben Lutkevich

## Reality:
### Real: 
- A concept/ idea that is integrated with one’s world view. 
- If referring to a concept/ idea that is unintegrated then the claim of reality is referring to the perceived integrability of the concept were they to expend the resources to do so. 
- The reality of the physical world means “if I was to go learn physics I could make predictions using the models of physics that are integratable with the rest of my world view”.
### Unreal: 
- A concept/ idea that is unintegrated with one’s worldview, their set of world models. When one claims unreality they are also executing a resource allocation function, where they declare that they are not going to expend the computation to integrate said concept/ idea.   
- Often used to reduce computation to track phenomena that occur with dynamics of high complexity and relativity to other systems. 
- Unreality of color means “the unfiltered presented by colors sends a signal so complex and relativised to the rest of one’s physiology and psychology, I am not going to bother integrating it with my worldview”. 

### Fact: 
- A piece of information that is found within one’s worldview. 
- Ofter refers to a concept within direct causal chain models of one’s world view. 
- Often refers to a concept found within one’s model of what is held in consensus by others.  
- Facts are not necessarily precise, they can sneak noise into their claims. 

## Truth:
### Correspondence Component:
- One’s inner models map to the world as determined by experience. This empirical analysis can be deferred to other systems/ other projections of time. 
- This includes language as one of the models being tested. The model of models. 
### Coherence Component:
#### How effectively do the models themselves integrate together? 
- A constituent component of correspondence, where the coherent theory is empirically tested against. 
### Pragmatic Component:
#### Resolving Selection Pressure
- Truth is often employable to confer survival value. Exceptions are rare. 
- This integrates epistemics methods of deriving truth with a model of its survival value. 
- The ultimate test of the correspondence and coherence of a worldview/ set of models is if it can be employed to maximize survival value given optimization constraints. 
- “Truth is what enables a system to be maximally selected for”.
- Systematic survival functions as the “eigenvector” that enables truth claims to be made and evaluated across levels of complexity. 

#### Organismic Economy Tracking 
- Seeing that the value of truth is the conference of survival value and the ability to resolve selection pressures, it leads to the problem of organismic economy tracking. 
- For truthful models to confer this value, the computational cost of employing them must be taken into account. The computational cost is directly proportional to the complexity of the given model.
- This complexity may or may not encode the required signal that is needed to maximize survival value given constraints. Some claims of truth on pragmatic grounds are evaluations that the complexity of the model is compatible with the organismic economic constraints. 

## Integrated truth
An idea/ concept is maximally truthful if it integrates the above, summarized by:
- Models correspond with experience.
- Resulting models are coherent.
- Ideas/ concepts and resulting models maximize survival value given pragmatic constraints. 

## Conclusions on truth
- Many perspectives of truth are means of reducing its perceived complexity. This enables compatibility with a strategy of cognitive frugality and functions as an attempt to be locally optimized. They are sometimes used to avoid looking at the problems maximally integrated truth is the requisite to solving. 
- Integrated truth requires maximizations across all these dimensions in a recursive manner. Truth and ethics are tightly integrated, as to maximize systematic survival, you must maximize the integrated truthfulness of your models. Ethics as recursive optimization, when applied to models of the world, is the process that maximizes the generation of integrated truth. 
- Since actions and models of action are so tightly connected in an organism'syste psychology, for them both to improve at the maximum rate the application of recursive optimization to both one's model and one's actions is required. 
- Focus on one constituent component is important to maximize precision and minimize error. When a constituent model is raised above the level of the integrated definition it is being used as an avoidance tool that provides the value of a cheaper computational cost compared to integrated truth. 
- Given the Consciousness of humans, if actions are ethical over the long term, possessing models of integrated Truth is just what performs this optimization in both domains.
