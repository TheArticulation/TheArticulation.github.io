In this post I will explore my takeaways from the 2022 OCON event. I will also provide my analysis of the current state of the Objectivist movement and provide my vision for its future. Sharing this post with the current leaders will either make it clear wether or not Objectivism is a charlatan's game or the foundation for the philosophy of the future. In terms of efficiency, there would be great value in being able to build off of the foundation Objectivism presents. However, I am willing to foolishly attempt to devolop a foundation of my own, if the current ones are just shallow illusions that will crumble when anything of integrety is build atop them. 

This year I attended the Sunday lectures of OCON 2022. They included: 
- Don Watkins: Don't Be Boring: Winning the Attention Game
- Ben Bayer: Ayn Rand on the Genealogy of Altruism
- Tal Tsfany: Spreading Objectivism: A Vision for ARI's Future
